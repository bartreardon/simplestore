# simplestore

an attampt at a simple django project to host a backend "store" for https://github.com/bartreardon/munki_client_resources/tree/master/purchase_buttons

currently it works for generating purchases json and the pricelist json.
self service "purchase" form is in a broken state so for testing you would need to manually add items
also, with no backend auth you'll need to hard code a user - again, should suffice for testing.

I've never django'd before so if you're a django dev, I apologise :p
